A fascist regime called the Fossarian Army rose up and started a global war in 1939. This Fossarian Army started spreading their influence forcefully over any country they could reach not separated by sea. By 1942, the Fossarian Army took control over every country in their immediate vicinity. in 1943, the entire world allies against the FA and created a coalition called the Legion of Allies to combat them. The LA began to gain ground on the FA after their invasion in 1944 of enemy territory by sea. once the LA landed, they steam rolled through all of the fascist controlled countries and pushed back the FA to their home country of Fossaria. by 1945 when the war was seemingly coming to an end, and the LA thought they had the upper hand, the FA released a unique weapon never before seen. Advanced technology they acquired through diplomatic relations with a previously unknown extraterrestrial power. This technology gave the FA the upper hand over the LA, it is more powerful then any man-made projectile based weapon and rips through all types of armour the LA has.

The year is now 1945, after many months of the LA getting decimated by this advanced technology, the smartest scientists of the Legion have come up with a single ship comprised of scrap pieces of salvaged enemy technology a ship the Legion calls the Lockheed Lightning Z-42, or the L.L. Z-42. You have been chosen to pilot the only ship which could turn the tide of this war. You are Earth’s last hope, and the only one who can stop this enemy uprising. Failure is not an option, as the freedom of Earth is in your hands. Your ship’s batteries are highly experimental, and once you’re in the air and behind enemy lines you won’t be able to resupply. This means you must choose your targets wisely as you have a limited supply of ammunition. 

Good luck First officer, we’re all counting on you.
